# Various code examples
Various code examples, that I have developed during my studies at KU

DAM examples are connected with the course titled Data Analysis Methods. 

Python files consist of various algorithms we had to implement to better understand the statistical methods that go into data analysis.


SB examples are connected with the course titled Structual Bioinformatics.

SB_Protein_...py is code developed as a modification to produce variations of clasical Ramachandran plots which are used to test the sturctual "correctness" of proteins in 3D space.

SB_RNA_...py is code developed to calculate the Nussinov algorithm of wild type and mutant sequences which then are compared Pearson's 
correlation coefficient. 

Example of R serves as an example of my ability to code in R. The exercises are from the course called Statistics for Bioinformatics and eScience.
